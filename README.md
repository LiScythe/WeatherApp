# Frontend Assessment
In this assessment, you will be required to demonstrate your understanding on:
1. Connecting and retrieval of data from API.
2. Performing validations and showing error messages appropriately.
3. Integration with third-party libraries.
4. Implementing best practises and clean codes, e.g. reusable codes that can be used repetitively, in different screens, projects, or by other team members.

# Deliverables
1. Create a screen that shows daily forecast for 7 days
    - You should connect to the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data. https://openweathermap.org/api

2. Create a second screen to show every 3 hours forecast for selected days from screen 1

## Sample Screen: 
This is just an example, feel free to improvise.
